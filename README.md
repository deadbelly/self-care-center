# Self Care Center
## Overview, Contributers, and Technologies
Self Care Center is a website that displays randomly selected affirmations and mantras to help center your mind. It was built by me, Boone Epstein, from a boilerplate designed by instructors at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) where I'm a student. It's a very simple site that only uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
This is just a simple website that runs in your web browser. It isn't deployed (yet?). 

When the user first loads the page they're greated by a calming layout, and a logo of a meditating person. They can select either a mantra or affirmation and then click `recieve message` to see a message selected at random from a list replace the logo. They can click on this message and edit it, and if they hit `enter` their new, custom message will be added to the appropriate list so they might see it later. If they click `let this message go` the display area will return to a logo of a meditating person. They cannot load a message if a message type is not selected- an alert will remind them to set their intention. Similarly if they try to clear a message when nothing is displayed and alert will remind them that they are already tabula rasa. As long as a message type is selected they can double-click the display area to enter a custom message, and save it the same way they could by editing a message- with the `enter` key.
